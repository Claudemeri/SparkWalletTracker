## Multi-Buy/Multi-Sell Detection

- 3 or more tracked wallets buy/sell the same token
- All transactions occur within the last 6 hours
- For buys: `subCategory` is "newPosition"
- For sells: `subCategory` is "sellAll"

### Alert Format

Multi-Buy Alert:

```
ðŸŸ¢ Multi Buy Alert!

[amount of wallets that bought] wallets bought [Token Symbol] in the last 6 hours!
Total: [total amount bought in SOL accross all wallets]

[Token Address]
```

Multi-Sell Alert:

```
ðŸ”´ Multi Sell Alert!

[amount of wallets that sold] wallets sold [Token Symbol] in the last 6 hours!
Total: [total amount sold in SOL accross all wallets]

[Token Address]
```

## Data Storage

The bot stores data in three JSON files:

- `wallets.json` - List of tracked wallets
- `tracked_tokens.json` - List of tracked tokens
- `transactions.json` - History of multi-buy/multi-sell transactions

## Moralis API Integration

The bot uses the Moralis API to fetch transaction data:

- Endpoint: `https://solana-gateway.moralis.io/account/mainnet/{wallet_address}/swaps`
- Checks transactions every minute
- Filters transactions from the last 6 hours
- Processes transaction types:
  - `newPosition` for buys
  - `sellAll` for sells

## Error Handling

The bot includes error handling for:

- API rate limits
- Network issues
- Invalid wallet addresses
- Transaction parsing errors
- Notification sending failures
